                This project was developed with one goal in mind: that all web developers have a place where they can easily and quickly find css animations to 
                adapt to their websites without the need to install libraries or packages, cattocss contains a generous list of css animations with access to its source code easily and quickly.

            In 2020 the first version of cattocss was launched on the internet, with a total of 80 animations of different styles. At the time it was thought to be a css animation library that needed to be downloaded.
            It got a considerable amount of views, and was even mentioned in some blogs, however, cattocss stopped receiving updates for almost over a year.

                    Some time ago I had a cat called "Misho", we rescued him from the street, and he became a new member of the family, he lived with us for a couple of years, however, he passed away unexpectedly.
                    <br><br>
                    That was a very significant period for me, because it was at the time when I started my path as a developer, so when I decided to create a project that would help me enter the world of development, I didn't want to miss the opportunity. to remember my friend, taking an orange cat as Misho as a logo and creating a name that was the combination of "Cat" and "Gato" (cat in Spanish), this is how the name cattocss was born.
                    <br><br>
                    "Tommy" has helped me get over the loss of "Misho" and I have committed myself to not making the same mistakes I did before, becoming much more responsible, understanding that a pet is much more than food and bed. 
                    <br>
                    Now Tommy and I are very close and I hope we can live many years together.
